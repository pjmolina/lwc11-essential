# Language Workbench Comparison 2011 - Essential version #

The [Language Workbench Competition](http://www.languageworkbenches.net) is an initiative created by a group of experts at the [Code Generation 2010](http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2010/) conference. The aim is to set a common task for Language Workbenches which is implemented with the different existing alternatives in a comparable way.

This project shows how to accomplish the tasks with [Essential](http://pjmolina.com/metalevel/essential).
